## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words

Through the means of this project I would like to visualise/depict the story of how a community of united redditors took down the giant Hedge funds of Wall Street and got rich while doing the same.
A few weeks ago, a bunch of people from the social media platform reddit started buying and propping up the stock of GameStop($GME) and a few other nearly dead stocks. There were throwing around slangs for the stock such as "To the moon ðŸš€" and "Diamond handsðŸ’Ž".

My interest in how social media can influence financial markets piqued during this time, and using this project I wish to analyse how they were able to create the massive impact in the stock market.

## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words

I have chosen the dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/gpreda/reddit-wallstreetsbets-posts) which has a CC0 Public domain license.
The dataset is a collection of 30000+ reddit posts from the subreddit [r/wallstreetbets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/). 
It has the following columns: 
- title
- score
- id (RIP)
- url (RIP)
- comms_num (renamed to 'num_of_comms')
- creation_timestamp (renamed to 'timestamp')
- message_body (renamed to 'body')
- data/time_timestamp (RIP)
---
- body_is_null
- containes_gme

I will use this to analyse how the posts in this dataset reflected the prices in the stock market during this timeframe.
